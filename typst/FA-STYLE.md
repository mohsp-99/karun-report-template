# FA-STYLE — the hand-numbered Persian report style

How to build a Persian (RTL) report in the `SUB06-QUO-140519-V5` style: Dubai
body text, sections numbered by hand in the heading text, table captions above /
figure captions below, and a strict bidi discipline for numbers and Latin
tokens.

The shared machinery lives in `karun-fa-style.typ` (import it — never re-implement
its helpers per report). `karun.typ` stays untouched: the engine (palette,
cover, running header/footer, TOC machinery, `to-fa-digits`, the Latin-in-Dubai
rule) is correct as shipped, and everything here sits on top of it.
`examples/fa-style-regression.typ` is the compact living reference for all of it.

## 1. The report file's setup block

Reproduce this order exactly at the top of a Persian report. The ordering is not
cosmetic — a Typst `set` rule applies **from its position in the document flow
onward**, so a rule declared after the cover leaves the cover unstyled.

```typ
#import "karun.typ": *
#import "<report>-metadata.typ": meta

#show: karun-report.with(lang: "fa", meta: meta)

// Dubai is the company body font, where the engine sets B Nazanin for Persian.
// This MUST come before the title and contents pages, or the cover, the
// metadata table and the table of contents stay in B Nazanin while the body
// runs in Dubai.
#set text(font: "Dubai")

#title-page(meta, lang: "fa")

// The engine's leading is tuned for B Nazanin's tall line-box; in Dubai the
// contents entries sit almost on top of each other. Open the gap between
// entries — this affects the outline only.
#show outline.entry: it => block(above: 12pt, below: 0pt, it)
#contents-page(lang: "fa")

#import "karun-fa-style.typ": *
#show: fa-refine

// Dubai's shorter line-box again: these values land the same ~1.5x line
// spacing the engine gives B Nazanin.
#set text(size: 11.5pt)
#set par(leading: 0.82em, spacing: 1.3em)
```

The contents must stay **one page**; 12 pt between entries is the value that
opens the list up without spilling over. If a report's outline grows, reduce
this rather than letting the TOC run onto a second page.

## 2. What `karun-fa-style.typ` provides

- `fa-refine` — the one document-wide show rule: heading auto-numbering off,
  Latin runs in Dubai at 0.9 em, headings sticky.
- `table-head-fill` / `table-line` / `table-zebra` — the table palette.
- `ktable(breakable: false, zebra: false, ..args)` — the branded table with a
  Karun-blue header band; its first row repeats when the table breaks.
- `ptable(breakable: false, ..args)` — the same look for a key/value table with
  no header row.
- `centred-first` / `centred-but-first` — alignment functions for `align:`,
  matching `|:---:|` columns in source Markdown.
- `note(body)` — block-quote callout with the accent rule on the right (RTL)
  edge.
- `lead(body)` — pins an introductory paragraph to what follows.
- `code(body)` — inline code as a tinted box. **Use this instead of `raw`**:
  the fallback monospace font is not bundled and cannot shape Arabic script, so
  a Persian identifier in `raw` comes out as disconnected letters.
- `todo` — an 8 pt unticked checkbox in Karun blue.
- `fa-enum` — `#show: fa-enum` makes `+` lists number in Persian digits.
- `fa-diagram(body, caption: none)` — numbers a diagram «شکل N», not "Figure N".
- `fa-flow(..steps, per-row: none)` / `fa-chain(..steps)` — Persian
  process-flow / steps-vertical with «گام ۱» counters; `per-row` splits a long
  flow over rows with the ramp and numbering continuous.
- `sn(body)` — compound section numbers, see below.

### `sn` — compound section numbers (the important fix)

A hand-written compound number such as «۸-۲.» renders **wrong** in every naive
form:

- Persian digits U+06F0–06F9 are bidi class **EN**, so «۸-۲» resolves to a
  single left-to-right number run and lays the **chapter number out on the
  left** — the reverse of what is wanted.
- The trailing full stop is not between two digits, so it falls back to the
  paragraph direction and is reordered to the **front**: «.۸-۲».
- **Boxing alone fixes only the full stop.** It makes the token atomic so the
  stop stays at the end, but the digits inside are still one number run and
  still read chapter-left.

Separating the parts with an RTL mark (U+200F) is what pins the order: each
digit group becomes its own run, and the runs lay out right to left — chapter on
the right, section on the left, full stop last. A multi-digit group such as
«۱۰» keeps its own internal left-to-right order, which is correct. `sn` applies
the mark via a show rule on the *separator*, so every call site stays the
literal number.

Use `sn[۸-۲.]` for every compound number — in headings, in contents entries, and
in inline cross-references such as «بند ۸-۱». A plain «۸.» needs no wrapper.

## 3. Local helpers to define in the report file

These are per-report, not library-level, because their tuning is content-driven.

```typ
// Level-1 sections open a new page — but by an explicit call before each
// heading rather than a blanket show rule, so short sections can be exempted.
// `weak` makes it a no-op when the section already starts a page.
#let newsec() = pagebreak(weak: true)

// A figure at an explicit fraction of the column width. `sticky` keeps it with
// the caption that follows; `breakable: false` stops the frame splitting.
#let fig(file, width: 100%) = block(
  width: 100%, breakable: false, sticky: true,
  align(center, image(file, width: width)),
)

// Figure caption — BELOW the figure: centred, 9pt, muted, italic.
#let fig-caption(body) = block(above: 7pt, below: 16pt, width: 100%)[
  #set align(center)
  #set par(justify: false)
  #text(size: 9pt, fill: rgb(90, 100, 114), style: "italic")[#body]
]

// Table caption — ABOVE the table: centred, 9.5pt, Karun blue, `sticky` so it
// cannot be separated from the table it introduces.
#let tbl-caption(body) = block(above: 14pt, below: 6pt, width: 100%, sticky: true)[
  #set align(center)
  #set par(justify: false)
  #text(size: 9.5pt, fill: karun-blue, weight: "medium")[#body]
]

// A footnote sitting directly under a table: 9pt, muted, justified.
#let tnote(body) = block(above: 6pt, below: 16pt, width: 100%)[
  #set par(justify: true, leading: 0.7em)
  #text(size: 9pt, fill: rgb(90, 100, 114))[#body]
]

// Price tables carry the weight of the commercial section: 11.5pt type, a
// deeper header band, generous padding, centred cells.
#let price-table(..args) = block(breakable: false)[
  #set par(justify: false)
  #set text(size: 11.5pt)
  #set table(
    inset: (x: 13pt, y: 10pt),
    stroke: 0.8pt + table-line,
    fill: (_, y) => if y == 0 { karun-blue.lighten(80%) } else { none },
    align: center + horizon,
  )
  #show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold", fill: karun-blue)
  #table(..args)
]

// Keeps a mixed Latin/Persian token whole — a model code «A-۱» — while leaving
// it laid out right to left, so the Latin letter stays on the right.
#let nb(body) = box(body)

// A wholly Latin technical token: «175 mm», «10 m/s²», «IEC 61587-1». A token
// opening with digits is bidi class EN, so the space before its unit resolves
// to the paragraph level and an RTL line renders it "mm 175". The LTR box pins
// the order and keeps the token unbreakable.
#let lt(body) = box(text(dir: ltr, body))
```

## 4. Layout rules the output must obey

1. **Page break before every level-1 section**, called explicitly with
   `#newsec()` before the heading. **Exempt the very short sections** — one lead
   paragraph plus a single list or table — which would otherwise stand on a
   two-thirds-empty page; let those run on from the section before. In V5 that
   is sections ۷ and ۱۰; eight of the ten sections get a break.
2. **Table captions above** («جدول ن — …»), **figure captions below**
   («شکل ن — …»). Both numbered by hand in Persian digits, since heading and
   figure auto-numbering is off.
3. **Every figure carries an explicit width**, chosen from what has to share the
   page with it and from the artwork's own pixel width, not run out to the full
   column by default. V5's values, as a calibration: a wide short render at
   100%, a 1016 px-wide piece of artwork at 58% (beyond ~60% it drops under
   200 dpi), a detail view at 85%, a hero and a branding shot at 92%.
4. **Non-breakable groups are what govern pagination** — a figure with its
   caption, a table with its caption and footnote. Get those right and the page
   breaks mostly take care of themselves.
5. **Block quotes become `note[…]` callouts**; **zebra rows with a repeating
   header** on long tables.

## 5. Writing conventions for the Persian body text

- **Ezafe**: write `ه‌ی` (he + ZWNJ + ye), never `ه` + U+0654 — the Persian face
  renders the hamza form so it reads as `ة`. Markdown sources typically arrive
  in the `هٔ` form; convert on the way in.
- **Numbers you type stay as typed.** Auto-numbering is off, so section, table
  and figure numbers are literal Persian digits in the source and are
  cross-referenced from prose by the same literal text.
- Wrap compound numbers in `sn[]`, Latin technical tokens in `lt[]`, mixed
  model codes in `nb[]`. These three are the whole bidi discipline.
- Gloss a Persian technical term with its English equivalent in parentheses at
  **first use only** — e.g. «پیچ اسیر پنل (Captive Panel Screw)».
- **Two Typst markup traps when pasting Markdown into a `.typ` file:**
  - `~` is a **non-breaking space**. Every "≈"/"~" in a source silently
    disappears — it compiles clean and drops the character. Escape it as `\~`.
  - `<word>` is a **label**, so something like `<2%` is a syntax error. Escape
    it as `\<`.

## 6. Build and acceptance checks

```sh
typst compile --font-path fonts <report>.typ "build/<Doc ID> - <title>.pdf"
```

Then verify, in this order:

1. **Render pages to PNG and look at them.** Compiling clean proves nothing
   about layout or bidi.
2. **Check the cover and the contents page are in Dubai**, not the engine's
   default face — the single most common regression, caused by a `set text`
   placed after `title-page`.
3. **Read a compound section number at 400 dpi** and confirm the chapter digit
   is on the right. Do not trust it at screen resolution: ۱ is a plain vertical
   stroke and ۲ is a hook, and they are easy to mistake for one another.
4. **Diff `pdftotext` output against the source as a character multiset.** Every
   character in the source must appear in the PDF. Do this after any bulk
   conversion, because of the `~` trap above. A word-level or line-level diff
   produces false positives — table cell reading order differs — so the
   character multiset is the authoritative check.
5. **Confirm the table of contents still fits on one page.**
